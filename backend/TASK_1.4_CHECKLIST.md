## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All migrations run successfully ✅

```bash
✔ Applied migration: 20251030054106_initial_schema
✔ Database is now in sync with schema
✔ Prisma Client generated successfully
```

**Evidence:**

- Migration files created in `prisma/migrations/`
- All 8 tables exist in database
- No migration errors

### 2. Seed data populates correctly ✅

```
📊 SEED SUMMARY:
👷 Workers: 10 ✅
🏢 Platforms: 5 ✅
📋 Tasks: 20 ✅
🌊 Streams: 8 ✅
💰 Transactions: 11 ✅

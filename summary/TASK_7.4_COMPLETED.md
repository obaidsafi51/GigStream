## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```tsx
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  date: string;
  type: "payout" | "advance" | "repayment" | "fee";
  amount: number;
  fee: number;
  status: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed";
  taskTitle?: string;
  platform?: string;
  txHash?: string;
  explorerUrl?: string;
  circleId?: string;
  confirmations?: number;
}
```

### State Management
- `transactions`: Array of transaction data
- `typeFilter`: Current type filter selection
- `statusFilter`: Current status filter selection
- `searchQuery`: Search input value
- `currentPage`: Current pagination page

### Helper Functions
- `formatDate()`: Formats ISO dates to readable format
- `truncateHash()`: Truncates long blockchain hashes
- `getTypeColor()`: Returns Tailwind classes for type badges
- `getTypeIcon()`: Returns emoji for transaction types
- `getStatusColor()`: Returns Tailwind classes for status badges
- `handleExportCSV()`: Generates and downloads CSV file

## CSV Export Format

```csv
Date,Type,Amount,Fee,Net Amount,Status,Task,Platform,TX Hash
"Oct 31, 2025, 02:30 PM","payout","12.50","0.25","12.25","completed","Food Delivery - Downtown","DeliveryApp","0x1a2b3c4d..."

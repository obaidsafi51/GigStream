## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [data, setData] = useState<DashboardData | null>(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Real-Time Updates
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    fetchDashboardData();
  }, 30000); // 30 seconds
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### Mock Data Structure
The dashboard currently uses realistic mock data that simulates:
- 30 days of payment history with random amounts ($200-$700/day)
- 8 top workers with decreasing performance metrics
- 10 recent transactions with various types and statuses
- Analytics summary with realistic numbers

### Dependencies Used
- **Recharts** (v3.3.0): Line charts for payment volume visualization
- **lucide-react**: Icons (DollarSign, Users, CheckCircle, TrendingUp, Award, Clock, ExternalLink)
- **UI Components**: Card, Badge from existing component library
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for all data structures

```typescript
{
  totalPayouts: "12,345.67",
  totalTasks: 542,
  activeWorkers: 87,
  weeklyRevenue: "1,234.56",
  payoutsChange: "+12.5%",

  tasks: 18
}
```

### Top Worker Entry
```typescript
{
  id: "worker-1",
  name: "Alice Johnson",
  walletAddress: "0x1234...5678",
  reputation: 900,
  tasksCompleted: 150,
  totalEarned: "5000.00",
  completionRate: 98,
  rank: 1
}
```

---

## Integration Points (Ready for Backend)

### 1. API Endpoint Integration
Replace mock data fetch with:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(
  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}/platforms/${platformId}/analytics`
);
const data = await response.json();
```

### 2. WebSocket/SSE for Real-Time Updates
Can be upgraded from polling to WebSocket:
```typescript
const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://api.gigstream.app/ws/platform/${platformId}`);
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const newData = JSON.parse(event.data);
  setData(newData);
};
```

### 3. Authentication
Already prepared for auth integration:
- Uses platform layout with role verification
- API calls will include auth tokens
- User context available from auth store

## Next Steps (Backend Integration)

### Task 9.4: Platform Analytics API (Day 9)
To complete the dashboard, the following backend work is needed:

1. **Analytics Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/platforms/:id/analytics
   ```
   Returns:
   - Total payouts (all-time and period changes)
   - Task counts (total, completed, active)
   - Worker counts (total, active, new)
   - Revenue metrics (weekly, monthly)

2. **Payment Volume Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/platforms/:id/payment-volume?days=30
   ```
   Returns array of daily payment data

3. **Top Workers Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/platforms/:id/workers/top?limit=10
   ```
   Returns ranked workers with performance metrics

4. **Recent Transactions Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/platforms/:id/transactions/recent?limit=10
   ```
   Returns latest transactions

### Migration Path
1. Create API endpoints (Task 9.4)
2. Replace mock functions with API calls
3. Add API error handling
4. Implement caching (5-minute cache recommended)
5. Add pagination for large datasets
6. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates

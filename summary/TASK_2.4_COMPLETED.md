---

## Deliverables Completed

### ✅ 1. Foundry Deployment Script (`deploy-contracts.mjs`)

**Location:** `contracts/scripts/deploy-contracts.mjs`

**Features:**

- **Prerequisite Validation:**
  - Checks Foundry installation (forge, cast)
  - Validates environment variables (DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY, ARC_RPC_URL)
  - Verifies deployer wallet balance
  - Warns if insufficient gas funds
- **Contract Compilation:**
  - Runs `forge build` before deployment
  - Validates successful compilation
- **Smart Deployment:**
  - Deploys ReputationLedger (no constructor args)
  - Deploys PaymentStreaming with Arc testnet USDC address
  - Uses Foundry's `forge create` command
  - Parses deployment output for addresses and tx hashes
- **Configuration Management:**
  - Updates `.env` with deployed addresses
  - Creates `contracts/deployments.json` with full deployment info
  - Generates TypeScript config for frontend (`frontend/lib/contracts.ts`)
- **User Experience:**
  - Colorized output with clear status indicators
  - Comprehensive error messages
  - Explorer links for deployed contracts
  - Step-by-step progress tracking

**Key Configuration:**

```javascript
// Arc Testnet USDC token address (official)
const ARC_TESTNET_USDC = "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238";
```

### ✅ 2. Post-Deployment Testing Script (`test-deployed-contracts.mjs`)

**Location:** `contracts/scripts/test-deployed-contracts.mjs`

**Features:**

- **Contract Verification:**
  - Reads deployment config from `deployments.json`
  - Verifies contracts are accessible on-chain
  - Checks contract code deployment
- **PaymentStreaming Tests:**
  - Read USDC token address
  - Verify stream count (initial state)
  - Check MIN_RELEASE_INTERVAL (60 seconds)
  - Check MAX_DURATION (30 days)
  - Verify pause status
  - Confirm owner address
  - Validate contract code size
- **ReputationLedger Tests:**
  - Read scoring constants (BASE_SCORE=100, MAX_SCORE=1000)
  - Verify authorized recorders
  - Check owner address
  - Test reputation queries
  - Validate contract code size
- **Gas Cost Estimation:**
  - Fetches current gas price from network
  - Estimates costs based on test suite results:
    - Create Stream: ~348,000 gas
    - Release Payment: ~29,000 gas
    - Claim Earnings: ~53,000 gas
    - Record Completion: ~27,000 gas
    - Record Dispute: ~15,000 gas

### ✅ 3. Deployment Configuration Files

**`contracts/deployments.json`** (auto-generated):

```json
{
  "network": "arc-testnet",
  "chainId": "5042002",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-01T...",
  "deployer": "0x...",
  "usdcToken": "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238",
  "contracts": {
    "PaymentStreaming": {
      "address": "0x...",
      "txHash": "0x..."
    },
    "ReputationLedger": {
      "address": "0x...",
      "txHash": "0x..."
    }
  }
}
```

**`frontend/lib/contracts.ts`** (auto-generated):

```typescript
export const CONTRACTS = {
  PaymentStreaming: "0x...",
  ReputationLedger: "0x...",
  USDCToken: "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238",
} as const;

export const NETWORK = {
  chainId: 5042002,
  name: "Arc Testnet",
  rpcUrl: "https://rpc.testnet.arc.network",
  explorerUrl: "https://explorer.testnet.arc.network",
} as const;
```

### ✅ 4. Environment Variable Updates

Updated `.env` to include deployed contract addresses:

```bash
CONTRACT_PAYMENT_STREAMING=0x...
CONTRACT_REPUTATION_LEDGER=0x...
```

### ✅ 5. Contract Verification Support

Prepared verification logic for when Arc explorer enables it:

```bash
forge verify-contract \
  --rpc-url $ARC_RPC_URL \
  <contract_address> \
  src/<ContractName>.sol:<ContractName> \
  --constructor-args <args>
```

Currently shows warning since verification may not be available yet.

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration

The deployed contracts are ready for backend integration (Tasks 3.3-4.4):

1. **Contract ABIs:**

   - Available in `contracts/out/PaymentStreaming.sol/PaymentStreaming.json`
   - Available in `contracts/out/ReputationLedger.sol/ReputationLedger.json`

2. **Contract Addresses:**

   - Stored in `.env` for backend access
   - Available in `deployments.json` for programmatic access

3. **Example Backend Usage:**

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import PaymentStreamingABI from "../contracts/out/PaymentStreaming.sol/PaymentStreaming.json";

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.ARC_RPC_URL);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  process.env.CONTRACT_PAYMENT_STREAMING,
  PaymentStreamingABI.abi,
  provider
);

// Read stream count
const count = await contract.streamCount();

// Create stream (with signer)
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
const contractWithSigner = contract.connect(signer);
await contractWithSigner.createStream(worker, amount, duration, interval);
```

### Frontend Integration

The auto-generated TypeScript config enables type-safe frontend usage:

```typescript
import { CONTRACTS, NETWORK } from "@/lib/contracts";

// Use contract addresses
const paymentStreamingAddress = CONTRACTS.PaymentStreaming;

// Use network info
const explorerUrl = `${NETWORK.explorerUrl}/address/${address}`;
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Contract Verification:**

   - Arc explorer may not support verification yet
   - Verification code is prepared but commented out
   - Manual verification may be required

2. **USDC Address:**

   - Hardcoded to Arc testnet USDC
   - Should be configurable for mainnet deployment
   - Update in deployment script if different testnet used

3. **Gas Price:**
   - Uses network's suggested gas price
   - May want to add gas price override option
   - Consider adding gas estimation before deployment

### Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Network Support:**

   - Add support for different networks (mainnet, other testnets)
   - Network-specific configuration files
   - Automatic network detection

2. **Deployment Upgrades:**

   - Add support for contract upgrades (proxy patterns)
   - Version management system
   - Migration scripts

3. **Advanced Verification:**

   - Automatic verification retry logic
   - Support for multiple block explorers
   - Source code flattening

4. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
   - Automated testing after deployment
   - Deployment notifications

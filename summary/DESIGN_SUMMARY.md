## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision       | Choice                    | Rationale                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Blockchain** | Arc Testnet               | USDC-native, low fees, Circle integration    |
| **Backend**    | Cloudflare Workers + Hono | Edge computing, auto-scaling, low latency    |
| **Database**   | PostgreSQL (Neon)         | Rich features (jsonb), serverless, free tier |
| **Frontend**   | React + TypeScript + Vite | Modern, fast, type-safe                      |
| **State Mgmt** | Zustand                   | Lightweight, simple API                      |
| **Styling**    | Tailwind CSS              | Rapid development, consistent design         |
| **AI**         | Heuristic fallback        | Reliable for MVP, can add ML later           |
| **Auth**       | JWT tokens                | Stateless, edge-friendly                     |

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Risks

**Risk: Arc testnet downtime during demo**

- Mitigation: Record backup video showing full flow
- Contingency: Use recorded video if live demo fails
- Prevention: Test connectivity before presentation

**Risk: Smart contract bugs**

- Mitigation: Extensive testing (Day 2-3)
- Contingency: Have fixes ready for common issues
- Prevention: Use OpenZeppelin libraries, code review

**Risk: Circle API rate limits**

- Mitigation: Implement caching and request batching
- Contingency: Use mock responses for demo
- Prevention: Monitor API usage daily

**Risk: Team member unavailable**

- Mitigation: Clear task documentation and handoff
- Contingency: Reassign tasks to other team members
- Prevention: Daily standups and status updates

**Risk: Scope creep**

- Mitigation: Strict prioritization (MVP features only)
- Contingency: Cut non-essential features
- Prevention: Daily scope review
